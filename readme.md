## :musical_note: Prepared tracker files

You can find it in the [tracks folder](./tracks)

# :checkered_flag: Flags

- track - Path to track file (musical file)
- delay - Delay in ms between taps (default is 80, increment it if your device can't catch all tones)
- start - Number of block where to start (default is 0)
- test - Run taps test for all musical instrument buttons (Check it before real usage)

Simple example:
```bash
./player --track ./tracks/zen_zen_zense.txt
```

# :1234: Block in tracker file

There are 3 blocks' types:
- **Delay** - several presentation types are available:
    - **Number** - milliseconds: `200 500` - :-1: Deprecated
    - **tN** - 200ms * N: `t t5 t10` - :-1: Deprecated
    - **Dash** - 200ms * dash_count: `- -- ---` - :star: Modern Variant
- **Note** - note in char notation like: `C4 A2 G5`
- **Chord** - chord like: `Am E G` (Not all notes available, use **Note** instead) - :-1: Deprecated

Please, use dash or t for timings, so you can change
the track speed by changing the `timing` comment.

```
#!TIMING:200
#!SHIFT:2
```

# :arrow_up_small::arrow_down_small: Tones transposing

The tool has an auto transpose mechanism.
So, if you are using `A4 B5 C4` then all notes for 4 octaves will be
transposed to 1 octave
```
[C4] [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ]
[A4] [  ] {  } {  } {  }
{  } {  } {  } {B5} (  )
```

If you want to use only second octave then make a `shift` comment
with value `7`. So, you'll shift all notes for 7 tones.

For example, without the comment `A4` position will look like:
```
[  ] [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ]
[A4] [  ] {  } {  } {  }
{  } {  } {  } {  } (  )
```
With the comment:
```
[  ] [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ]
[  ] [  ] {  } {  } {  }
{  } {  } {A4} {  } (  )
```

# :information_source: Game notes

```
[C1] [D1] [E1] [F1] [G1]
[A1] [B1] {C2} {D2} {E2}
{F2} {G2} {A2} {B2} (C3)
```

```
C1   D1   E1   F1   G1   A1   B1   C2   D2   E2   F2   G2   A2   B2   C3
```
